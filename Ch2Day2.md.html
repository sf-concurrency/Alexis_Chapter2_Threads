### Notes on ReentrantLock

Java API docs:

> A reentrant mutual exclusion Lock with the same basic behavior and
> semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using synchronized
> methods and statements, but with extended capabilities.

(In general, a re-entrant lock is just a lock that can be acquired
multiple times by the same thread without deadlocking on itself. If
the lock were not re-entrant, it would deadlock on itself, because it
would not be able to acquire the lock the second time since it had not
released it from the first time.)

Some notes on how ReentrantLock differs from the "implicit monitor
lock" attached to every object:

- can be locked/unlocked from different methods. Since they are not
  locked and unlocked by the beginning and ending of a `synchronized`
  block, they are not restricted to being ???
- thread can timeout while waiting to acquire lock
- thread can be interrupted while waiting to acquire lock
- include a condition variable with a (signal/wait) mechanism.

Insomuch as the ReentrantLock seems to prevent *one* mode of deadlock due to acquiring locks not in the global fixed locking order -- namely, acquiring the same lock twice -- it seems like it can be regarded as a lock with special abilities which reduces the requirements on how it is used.

### Notes on condition variables

Literally, a condition variable is an actual variable in the program
text. Conceptually, it is a mechanism used for communicating from one
thread to one or more other threads, to wake them once a condition has
been met. The literal variable is used to support this mechanism.

To recap the confusables:

- the actual *condition variable* appears in the program code, merely
  to be used as an argument for the `wait`, `signal`, and `signalAll` (aka, `broadcast`) functions. It
  does not embody or contain the logical condition.

- the *logical condition* is a logical condition defined and managed
  by the program. When it is false, threads should call `wait` on the
  condition variable. When it becomes true, a thread should call
  `signal` in order to wake up the waiting threads.

- Every condition variable operation must be performed while a *mutex
  lock* is locked. Why? This ensures atomicity of testing the
  condition and calling wait, and of testing the condition and
  calling signal.

Here is how the happy path works:

1. thread calls `theLock.lock()`, acquiring the lock
2. thread calls `theCondition.await()`
3. -> thread relinquishes theLock and thread becomes dormant
4. Some other thread calls `theCondition.signal()`
5. -> thread tries to re-acquire the lock
6. -> thread re-acquires the lock and returns from `await()`

### Minidemo: NSCondition vs Java condition variables

Why do the Java ones seem to require to be used only within a synchronized block?

How does this relate to GCD semaphores? 

### Notes on monitors

A *monitor* is really a pattern for using locks or conditional
variables to protect access to a shared object.

It seems like any of those constructs can be called a monitor if it used as a monitor -- that is, if it is used to protect a shared resource from invalid multithreaded access.

## "Find"


Q: Find ReentrantLock supports a fairness parameter. What does it mean
for a lock to be “fair”? Why might you choose to use a fair lock? Why
might you not?

A: Fairness or non-fairness determines which thread is most likely to
acquire the lock when many are blocked and waiting. If fairness=true,
then the longest waiting thread gets control. This is guaranteed to
prevent live lock but it reduces overall concurrency.

Q: What is ReentrantReadWriteLock ? How does it differ from
ReentrantLock ? When might you use it?

A: A ReentrantReadWriteLock provides both a writeLock and a readLock
which together can be used to allow one writer but multiple
readers. Only one writing thread can hold the write lock. Many reading
threads can hold the read lock.

Q: What is a “spurious wakeup”? When can one happen and why doesn’t a
well- written program care if one does?

A: Spurious wakeups are calls to `signal`, in association with a
condtion variable, when the condition does not actually hold. Some
times threads holding locks with condition variables will be awoken by
`signal` even when no other thread signaled the condition
obtained. This is called a spurious wake up. Code waiting for signals
on condition variables needs to handle this correctly, by manually
checking the condition itself.

Q: What is AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater ? How does it differ from
AtomicInteger ? When might you use it?

A: it's not an atomic integer field, but an abstract class that acts
as a factory that creates an object which can be used to atomically
update a volatile int field of another class.


## Do

1. What would happen if the loop within the “dining philosophers”
   implementation that uses condition variables was replaced with a
   simple if statement? What failure modes might you see? What would
   happen if the call to signal was replaced by signalAll ? What
   problems (if any) would this cause?

If the loop were replaced with a conditional, then the thread could
incorrectly get the lock due to a spurious wakeup, and proceed even
tho the condition does not obtain. Since the thread would be running
code requiring this precondition to be met, when it was not in fact
met, this would produce undefined results.

If `signal` were replaced by `signalAll`, then when one philosopher
put down his chopsticks, not only the philosophers next to him would
be woken up to try to pick up chopsticks but all 


2. Just as intrinsic locks are more limited than ReentrantLock, they
   also support a more limited type of condition variable. Rewrite the
   dining philosophers to use an intrinsic lock plus the wait and
   notify or notifyAll methods. Why is it less efficient than using
   ReentrantLock ?

What intrigued me about this question is its implication that every kind of lock gives rise to a different kind of condition variable. Is this true?

3. Write a version of ConcurrentSortedList that uses a single lock
   instead of hand-over-hand locking. Benchmark it against the other
   version. Does hand- over- hand locking provide any performance
   advantage? When might it be a good choice? When might it not?
